**Introduction**

End Game Enhanced is a mod that aims to, well, enhance the end game by adding new best in slot items for almost every slot, as well as new reasons to kill just about every aggressive Mob in the game, including the Warden. This will be a brief introduction but anything you want to know about this mod can be found in the Github wiki I've made, which is linked to this project. I currently only plan on updating the mod with the newest version of Minecraft and the wiki will reflect this. Let's get right into it by looking at some of the new best in slot items.

**Inevitable items**

Inevitable items are a new tier above Netherite. They aren't meant to be overpowered, but provide some powerful effects and have unique properties. There are 14 Inevitable items in total and to collect them all you'll need to go just about everywhere, kill just about everything, and do just about everything the vanilla game has to offer.

**How to obtain them**

Inevitable items are crafted using the Smithing Table the same way you might be familiar with making Netherite gear in vanilla. So you'll need a Smithing Template, an upgrade ingredient, and your base item. The next couple of sections will explain these items a bit more, starting with the Smithing Templates.

**Smithing Templates**

Inevitable Smithing Templates are obtained from different loot sources all over the game and there's a unique one for every Inevitable piece of gear. The only exception being the Obsidian Armor, which all use the same Template. There are 11 Inevitable Smithing Templates in total.

**Essence**

Essence is made by combining blocks, mob drops, and various other items. This Essence is then combined in specific ways to make Pure Essence, which are used as the upgrade ingredient in Inevitable Smithing. There are 53 Essence in total, including Pure Essence.

**Unique mob, crop, and block drops**

Nearly every aggressive mob in the game has been given a unique item they drop and several crops have also been given unique drops. These unique items are used to make Essence. Most of them also have conversion recipes, so they can be turned into vanilla items. There are 30 unique mob drops, 9 unique crop drops, and 2 unique block drops.

**Netherite Upgrade path**

Netherite is no longer a direct upgrade from Diamond. Diamond must now be upgraded to Onyx and then to Netherite, each using a different new Smithing Template. While a Netherite ingot is of course still the ingredient for Netherite, you'll need an Onyx to upgrade from Diamond, which is one of the several new gems.

**Gems**

Five new Gems have been added, as well as new ways of obtaining and using existing vanilla gems by randomly obtaining them from mining ores and killing some mobs. All ores and some mobs roll a gem table when they're mined or killed and those gems can be used to craft tools, among other things. In total there are 7 Gems, including the Diamond and Emerald from vanilla. The Onyx being the most rare and valuable of them all.
